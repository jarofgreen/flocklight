Flocklight "Making big events more personal!"
=============================================

At a big event we search the twitter data of all those attending, trying to 
highlight the personal connections between the attendees.
We try to make your experience of the event more personal and social!

We are not interested in turning this data into some kind of score so someone 
can be crowned the "winner!" at twitter, we think that's silly. 
Instead we are trying to provide you with useful information to help you connect
with others at the event easily.
